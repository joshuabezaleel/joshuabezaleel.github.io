      <description>All the best people that I had pleasure working with on my professional journey both have the same characteristic.&#xA;They leverage/support/sponsor others from where they&amp;rsquo;re positioned. This position that I am referring to apply to both level-wise (managerial (manager, director), or even Individual Contributor (architect)), or role-wise (QA, product manager, designer, engineer, SRE).&#xA;There are various occasion that prompt me to write about this one but it was definitely the great coworkers around me that I am grateful of.</description>
