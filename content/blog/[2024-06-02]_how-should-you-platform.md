This is some observation that I got on the practices that either infrastructure people that is going to start the journey in platform engineering or for people that have been practicing for a while that is looking for some lesson-learned from other companies. Will keep this list alive for a while in case there are new ones that I got.

1.  Proper width of abstraction
    TBA

2.  Captive audience
    TBA

3.  Shared responsibility model

    TBA

4.  Keep your allies (power-users) close

    TBA

5.  Usually they already had an existing something to scratch their own itch

    TBA

6.  Standardization with golden path, but be open to experimentation and ideas

    TBA
