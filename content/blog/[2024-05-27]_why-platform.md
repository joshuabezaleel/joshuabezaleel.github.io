Platform engineering has taken the infrastructure community by the storm in the recent days. Various talks on the recent KubeCons are mostly all about platform, on par with talks on AI. And as all hype should be, I am usually on the more skeptic side and I believe we should've taken them more objectively, not as is. Even though that I am currently working on the infrastructure and platform on day-to-day basis, I can really understand the POV of the people that are skeptic on this one and I believe that both gave really good perspectives on their corresponding point of views so it results in a healthy discussion in the community. 

I think one of the best take of it is being put by the one and only Kelsey here.

On the benefit of establishing platform engineering, there are already a bunch of blogposts that talks about this.

Even though that it might seem to be obvious, why not earlier.

1. Product management is just growing, earlier it was more on product development that is user-facing.

1. Infra dev is burned out.

1. We just got the abstraction matured recently. S3, etc.
