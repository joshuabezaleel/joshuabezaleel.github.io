It wasn't actually an intentional plan to join this team, as if I wanted to pivot into the infrastructure field. At that time, I felt stuck, thinking that I wouldn't be able to grow better than where I was. Then I remembered I knew a senior back in my university from the infrastructure community, which turns out had a vacancy on their team. I was sure that I wouldn't be able to get accepted in the team since there are a lot of people that I look up to. They are known, they have a voice, and they give back to the community, but above all, I knew they are kind, decent human being. Hence, I tried to make the leap of faith.

Fast forward a year and a half from then. As someone who was thinking to start their career in non-engineering roles because he just wasn't born with the technical skill - which I finally did simply just because I don't want to die with what ifs - I would've never imagined I could say to myself that I am enjoying what I am working on a daily basis.
