It wasn't actually an intentional plan to join this team, as if I wanted to pivot into the infrastructure field. At that time, I felt stuck, thinking that I wouldn't be able to grow better than where I was. Then I remembered I knew a senior back in my university from the infrastructure community, which turns out had a vacancy on their team. I was sure that I wouldn't be able to get accepted in the team since there are a lot of people that I look up to. They are known, they have a voice, and they give back to the community, but above all, I knew they are kind, decent human being. Hence, I tried to make the leap of faith.

Fast forward a year (and a half, actually, since I joined on November 2022) from then. As someone who was thinking to start their career in non-engineering roles because he just wasn't born with the technical skill - which I finally did simply just because I don't want to die with what ifs - I would've never imagined I could say to myself that I am enjoying what I am working on a daily basis.

## What the team is working on
The team started as what was known as Payment Infrastructure, since it was responsible for the infrastructure of the "solely" Consumer Payment product on GoTo Financial subsidiary (of GoTo), which is mainly the GoPay digital wallet. Since (1) GoTo Financial comprises of various acquired companies ranging from Point of Sales, lending and installments, merchant gateway, and various other companies, with started with their own infrastructure and (2) our team had the considerably more mature infrastructure offering among others, we were also tasked to consolidate all of the other companies' services, databases, and all other product components to be onboarded on our infrastructure, hence perhaps renaming ourselves as GoTo Financial (GTF) Infrastucture.
