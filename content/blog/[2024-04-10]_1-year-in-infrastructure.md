It wasn't actually the plan all along to join this team. 
The team berisi people that I look up to. People that grow others in the. People that give back to the community. People that I knew dari yang dibilang2 di luar, best culture they are working with.
And as someone who immensely felt the impostor syndrome and felt stuck, I tried to make the leap of faith.

Fast forward a year and a half from then, here I am now. As someone who was thinking into non-engineering because he wans't born to, which finally did simply just because I wasn't dying penasaran karena tidak mencoba, I would never imagine that I could say to myself I enjoyed doing.
