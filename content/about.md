## Professional

I am currently working on {platform,system,infrastructure,devops,cloud,devex,sre} engineering at [GoTo Financial](https://www.gotocompany.com/en/products/goto-financial) on the Developer Experience and Developer Tooling team as part of the Infrastructure Engineering department. 

What the team is working on is written on [this press writeup](https://www.thejakartapost.com/adv-longform/2022/06/16/gopay-sh-a-glimpse-into-indonesias-leading-e-wallet-gopays-developer-experience.html) and accessible in these following talks:
- KubeCon North America 2021 [[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE1Qujq51nM&pp=ygUUa3ViZWNvbiBnaXJpIGt1bmNvcm8%3D)]
- KubeCon North America 2023 [[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19vx14_Z4sw&pp=ygUfa3ViZWNvbiBuYSAyMyBidWlsZGluZywgc2NhbGluZw%3D%3D
)]
- KubeDay Singapore 2023 [[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghQJNIvBsYk)]

In the past, I used to contribute to open-source projects like [google/go-github](https://github.com/google/go-github/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Ajoshuabezaleel), [CNCF's Porter](https://twitter.com/birthmarkbart/status/1765747636764627247), and [mattermost/mattermost-server](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Ajoshuabezaleel), dabbled in side project on distributed system [[1](https://materializedview.io/p/viewstamped-replication-deterministic-simulation), [2](https://github.com/joshuabezaleel/vrr-go)] and other [[1](https://github.com/joshuabezaleel/go-support)], or ran communities [[1](https://github.com/cloudnative-id/kubernetes-cloud-native-bandung), [2](https://github.com/GoBandung)]. I hope I can find time and energy again outside of work in the future since those were lots of fun.

## Personal

I am easily fascinated and I find many things around us beautiful but I think many people have poured much more time to those various things so I am not sure about listing them out. Maybe I'll tell about them in detail next time.
